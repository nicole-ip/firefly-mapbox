# Live Location Indicator with Risk Assessment

## Overview

This is a React-based application that provides a live location indicator on a map, along with a real-time incidents assessment feature. The application uses TypeScript, the Shadcn UI library, and the react-mapbox-gl library to create a visually appealing and functional user interface.

## Features

1. **Live Location Indicator**: The application displays the user's current location on a map in real-time, using the user's device location data.

2. **Risk Assessment**: The application is generating incident data based off the initial coordinates (located in Manhattan). The data includes the title, description, timestamp and severity to provide users with a better understanding of their surroundings. This information is displayed in a news feed-like format, as well as with markers on a map.
